Searchsploit 2
==============

An alternative to the searchsploit shell script. Just a quick thing I whipped up a while ago.


Usage:
===============

This tool assumes you already have a copy of the original searchsploit or at a minimum have the files.csv file available in the same directory. If you already have that then you're all set to go! Search exploits to your hearts content! <3
